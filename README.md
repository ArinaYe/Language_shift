# Language_shift
This internship report predicts the language evolution in Hong Kong using agent-based modeling, and conducts a comparative study between the two programming languages -- Julia and Python. My project is based on Beltran's paper (2009) and utilizes language statistics from Hong Kong to conduct a study on language evolution, with Mandarin as the dominant language and Cantonese as the subordinate language. Beltran's paper described a model with three states in a bilingual community and implemented the model using a Microsoft Excel 2007 spreadsheet. We adopted his model but implemented it using both Julia and Python, which makes the visualization simpler and easier to understand. Hong Kong offers a unique and valuable context for studying language change, as it has a large Cantonese-speaking population alongside many immigrants, including Mandarin speakers from mainland China and people from abroad. Furthermore, the government regularly collects language data, providing a robust foundation for my research.
